## PyEsmini
Python wrapper for [Environment Simulator Minimalistic (esmini)](https://github.com/esmini/esmini).

To build on Ubuntu, simply run the following command that downloads the codes and resources and builds the esmini's shared objects:
```
./build.sh
```

A sample Python code:
```
pyesmini = PyEsmini("resources/xosc/pedestrian.xosc")
print("First object name: ", pyesmini.getObjectName(0))

for i in range(500):
    pyesmini.step()
```
